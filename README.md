| High Level Purpose Statement:      | I want to learn how to use Maven to bundle an existing Java project and deploy it, along with managing dependencies.  |
| :-------- | :------- |
| Experimental Design | For this lab I will use Lab3/Lab4 from OOP due to it requiring an external dependancy and containing many classes. I have Maven installed from another class, but I will need to learn how to add support for Maven to an existing project and configure it. |
| Resources Available    | I found numerous resources from Apache, JetBrains, and W3Schools. JetBrains has a guide on how to add support for Maven to an existing Java project, so I will follow that. |
| Time Estimate: | I believe this project will take about 3 hours. From my very limited experience with Maven I know that the built in support for it in Intellij is very good, and the guides I found are not very long and contain simple steps. |
| Experiment Notes: |  |
